# Contributing to the project

## Documentation

Documentation should always be written in English. This includes but is not limited to:

- Code comments
- Commit messages
- Pull request descriptions
- Readme files

## Contributions

We operate under a team agreement that mandates all Pull Requests (PRs) must be reviewed and approved by at least one team member before merging.

## Pull Requests and Merging

1. **Create Descriptive PRs**: Summarise your changes clearly.
2. **Code Reviews**: Every PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
3. **Exceptions**: PRs solely updating from the master branch or involving minor changes do not require new approvals.
4. **Responsibilities**: Authors address review comments; Reviewers provide timely feedback.

## Deploys

- **No** deploys when people are not active and ready to help out during an incident (i.e., vacation, sick leave, etc).
- **No** deploys on Fridays, unless you want to work on the weekend. Emergency deploys are allowed.
- **No** deploys after 15:00, unless you want to work late. Emergency deploys are allowed.

## Branching Strategy

### Naming Convention

When creating a new branch, use the following naming convention:

`<Initials>/<Issue-Number>-<Brief-Description>`

- **Initials**: Your initials, to indicate who is working on this branch.
- **Issue-Number**: The issue number from the project's issue tracker (if applicable).
- **Brief-Description**: A short description of what the issue or feature is about.

#### Example:

If your initials are `JL` and you are working on an issue numbered `1337` that involves fixing a typo, the branch name should be: `JL/1337-fix-typo`.

### Branching Off

Always branch off from the `master` branch and make sure your local `master` is up to date before creating a new branch. You are allowed to branch off from your own branch if you want to split up your work.
